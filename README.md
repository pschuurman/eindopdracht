# INTRODUCTION

Ever wondered what to have for breakfast, lunch or dinner, because you were in the mood to try something completely different? 
Or on the lookout for a recipe that doesn’t contain a certain allergen, because a friend became allergic to it? 
You can have all sorts of reasons to be looking for a specific recipe.

In this application I tried to sort a bunch of questions out for you. You can search on six different topics
- Your favourite kitchen 
- Whatever there is left in your fridge
- The type of meal you're in the mood for
- An allergen that has to be excluded
- The time you have available 
- Or be surprised by just handing you a random recipe

Based on your input this application will provide you recipes that you might not even have heard off. 
Excited to get started? You’re only a few steps away:

- Open the terminal in your IDE
- Type in `npm install` 
- After installation type `npm start` 
- Open your webbrowser and type in: http://localhost:3000

Happy searching and enjoy your meal!

# Further Development

If you are planning to work on this application the following available scripts might be of interest for you:

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. 
All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.
You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. 
However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
